# Creators2017
This repository keeps all the code created by the creators group in the 2017/2018 term.  In 2017, the Creators group was led by Kieran and Mark.

## What is the Creators Group?
The Creators group in Coderdojo Athenry works on **creative aspects** of coding - this means learning how to use code to build interesting art, simulations, games and random goofy stuff!  

## What languages do you use?
In 2017, we are focusing mainly on **javascript** but also are covering lots of things like html, good code management, etc.
